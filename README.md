# Lab Summary
The goal of this lab is to understand how to utilize several electronic testing instruments that will be used in future experiments. In this lab, we tested xyz with abc
# Methods/Tests: 
Engineering documentation necessary to repeat the project. Should include:
Drawings
Pictures
# Results: Data or outcome from the work. 
Should include:
Tables

**1)**

| Color Code  | Expected Resistance (&Omega;) |  Maximum Value (&Omega;) |  Minimum Value (&Omega;) |   Measured Resistance (&Omega;) | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| Yellow, Violet, Green, Gold  | 4,700,000  | 4935000  | 4465000 |4,758,000  |
| Brown, Green, Black, Gold | 15  | 15.75  | 14.25  | 19.4  |
| Brown, Gray, Brown, Gold  | 180  | 189  | 171  | 185.2  |
| Gray, Red, Red, Gold  | 8,200  | 8,610  | 7,790  | 8,250  |

| Code  | Expected Capacitance |  Maximum Value |  Minimum Value |   Measured Capacitance | 
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| 22j | 22.0pF | 23.1pF | 20.9pF | 0.30nf |
| 105Z | 1.00uF | - | - | 1.19uF |
| 102 | 1.00nF | - | - | 1.30nF |
| 470uF | 470uF | - | - | 522uF |

Note: Minimum DMM measurement is 300pF

b. Polarity did **NOT** impact the reading of the electrolytic capacitor becuase it is a passive component.

| Voltage | Minimum Current | Measured Voltage |
| ---- | ---- | ---- |
| 1.5V | 250mA | 1.484V - 1.521V |
| 7V | 250mA | 6.99V - 7.01V |
| 12V | 250mA | 11.98V - 12.01V |
| Aux 3.3VDC | N/A | 3.416V |
| AUX 5.0VDC | N/A | 5.214V |
| AUX 12VDC | N/A | 12.06V |

Note: Auxillary ports use less than 0.1A, so current not measured
