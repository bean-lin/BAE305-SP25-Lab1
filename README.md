# Laboratory Report for Lab 1 of BAE305 Spring 2024
## Lab 1 â€“ Well-Equipped
### Introduction
In this lab, we learned to use several important pieces of electronic test equipment and to use github to submit our reports.

### Lab Exercises
*Objective 1: Use the above listed lab equipment to measure and verify equipment, component and circuit values.*
Task:
-	Measure and verify the resistance of various resistors.
-	Measure and verify the capacitance of various capacitors.
-	Measure and verify the voltage output of the DCPS.
-	Measure and verify the function generator output.

Steps:
1. You have been given four resistors.  For each resistor, determine its actual resistance value using the Fluke DMM.  In a table, summarize the color code, expected resistance, maximum and minimum values to be within the tolerance, and measured resistance.  Note any resistors that do not fall within allowable values. Connect the positive and common leads and measure the resistance of the cables. If you add this value to the previously measured, do the resistors still fall within their tolerance?

**Resistor Values Table**
|Expected|Measured|Within|
|Value|Value|Tolerance|
|(Ohms)|(Ohms)||
|----------|----------|----------|
|100K|99.89K|Yes|
|21|45|No|
   
2. Similarly, you have been given four capacitors.  Measure the capacitance of each using the Fluke DMM.

**Capacitor Values Table**
|Expected|Measured|Within|
|Value|Value|Tolerance|
|(uF)|(uF)||
|----------|----------|----------|
|1|1.05|Yes|
|0.0002|0.032|No|

a. Do the instruments agree with the expected value? **No**
b. Does the polarity affect the measurement of the electrolytic capacitor? **No**
3. Power Supply Check

**Capacitor Values Table**
|Expected|Measured|
|Value|Value|
|(V)|(V)|
|----------|----------|
|1.5|1.48|
|7|7.12|
|12|12.32|

a. Q2: Do the instruments agree with each other? **Kinda**
4. Function Generator use
**Function Generator Table**
**Capacitor Values Table**
|Method|Wave Type|Frequency|Amplitude|
|----------|----------|----------|----------|
|Set|Sinusoidal|2KHz|10V+|
|Oscilloscope Counting squares|2KHz|12Vp-p| 
|Oscilloscope Measure Features|Sinusoidal|2.55KHz|11Vp-p|
|Oscilloscope Moveable Cursors|Sinusoidal|2.5KHz|10.5Vp-p|
|Fluke DMM|-----|-----|3.6Vrms|
 
a. Q3: Do the instruments agree? **Kinda**
Change the frequency and amplitude of the generated sinusoidal and observe what happens in the oscilloscope and DMM.

*Objective 2: Learn how to use GitHub for collaboration and to post your report.*
Task:
Did the Github Worked?

4.	Go to the Wiki tab and create your lab report on the wiki page.
5.	A basic template for the text in the Wiki is provided at: https://github.com/joedvorak/BAE305-Sp19-Lab1/blob/master/ReportExample.md. 
6.	To add images, upload them to the repository. Copy the link to the image in the repository and then add it to the Wiki using the image button which lets you provide the link.
7.	In Canvas, submit a link to your report page on GitHub.
